## disk partitioning 

#### types

##### swap
The swap partition is used to ==extend the virtual memory== and allows for suspend to disk support (sleep mode). The memory can be extended by using the hard disk as ==a temporary extension to the RAM.== The suspend to disk process saves power while the computer is idle by temporarily storing all of the active processes in RAM, and cutting power to most other devices. The swap partition allows for an extension of the process onto the hard drive. 
##### root
The root partition allows the user to communicate with the linux kernel. This partition serves as ==the general storage location for user data.==
##### boot
