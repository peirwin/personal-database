## Electricity and magnetism

Proven to be linked by Alessandro Volta with a battery

Hans christian orsted proved that the magnetic compass could be manipulated by a current

Andre marie ampere experimented with two parallel wires with current
+ if the current was the same, the wires would attract
+ if they were reversed, they would be reprelled

Amperes law: directly proportional to the length and current, inversely proportional to the distence between the wires

fereday experimented with coills of wire. The magnetic fields build across 2 adjacent active coils of wire. Mutual induction: the magnetic field of one coil will grow onto the magnetic field of the other coil
