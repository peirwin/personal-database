## transistors

---

before the transistor: vacuum tube
	-cathode (transmites current)
	-grid (switch between the two
	  - [[ENIAC]] had 18000 vacuum tubes
	-anode (receives currrent)

cpu transistors:
	- contained on silicon crystal (semiconductor)
	- silicon has 4 valence (readily forms bonds w/ other silicons)
		- if phosphorus is added, an electron is free to roam (N type)
		- if boron is added, a hole is free to roam (P type)
	- a transistor is constructed using these types in the NPN order
		- the border between these types causes a negative depletion layer, which prohibits electrons from passing through the P (positive) type material. It is call ed the p type because the positively charged holes are free to roam. The holes within the P type are filled by free electrons in the neighboring N types, which acts as a barrier for incoming electrons. If a voltage is applied to the P type, the electrons are then free to pass.
