### Summary to revise
In Baldwin's article on Black Language, he argues that the distinction of a language is most reliant on attributes specific to the community of the language's speaker, rather than linguistic structure. For example, French is the primary language of Paris, Marseilles, Quebec, and Senegal. Although these locations' communities differ in small communication quirks, there is no communicative wall between the speakers of each location. Baldwin then compares this to Black English, where he argues a wall of communication lies between that of white Americans and black Americans. The existence of this wall implies that “language is also a political instrument, means, and proof of power. It is the most vivid and crucial key to identity. It reveals the private identity” (1). Black language, and thus black identity, have been simultaneously co-opted and judged by white Americans as a result of the communicative barrier. The effect of such judgment exposes a power dynamic between white and black Americans, which can be rooted in American history. The black community is then patronized as a result of this barrier and power dynamic, being labeled as a mere "dialect" as opposed to a language. The perceived irrelevance of Black English is due to America’s lack of understanding of the lived black experience, an experience which has been largely ignored by America at large. Conclusively, Baldwin indicates that language, identity, and experience, particularly as they relate to matters of race in America, are connected.
