### Notes
**Proposition**: a statement that can be true or false
- In computer science and mathematics, a propositional truth value is based on the syntax of the expression
**Operators**: 
$$ begin{array}{c|}
\lnot 
\end{array} $$


NOWWW

Satisfaction: the statement can be true
Contradiction: the statement cannot be true
Tautology: the statement can ONLY be true
Contingency: the statement can be true or false

Logical Equivalence: both statements have equal truth table values
Formula Consistency: one truth assignment satisfies all present formulas
Argument: a set of formulas (premises) and a conclusive formula (conclusion)
- An argument is valid if an only if every truth assignment that satisfies all the premises also satisfies the conclusion
- An argument is invalid if and only if there is at least one truth assignment which satisfies all the premises, but not the conclusion
