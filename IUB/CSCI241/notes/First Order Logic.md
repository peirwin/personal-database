quick notes:

FOL is about checking the validity of statement under specific quantities. 
Because FOL is centered around quantities, an atomic proposition cannot stand alone as a single variable, we must specify what quantities are attributed to the proposition.

Attributes of a FOL statement:

- terms: objects/values | types: ==constant== term and ==variable== term { a free variable is unbound (outside the scope of a quantifier)}
- predicates: properties to validify per term | types: ==unary== predicate and ==binary== predicate
	- descriptors: domain = specified universal set 
	- ex: E(f) | E = predicate, f = constant term.
- quantifiers: ==universal== = $\forall$, ==existential== = $\exists$
