# Basic Properties of Numbers 
--- 
## Associativity
Suppose we have one operation that inputs two numbers a and b nested in a function that has has the same operation on c and the nest:
if the operation can be expressed as c "op" (a "op" b) and equate to a "op" (b "op" c), the operation is noted as associative

## Commutativity 
Suppose we have one operation that inputs two numbers a and b:
if the operation can be expressed as (a "op" b) and equate to (b "op" a), the operation is noted as commutative

(a+b)+c = a+(b+c) (associative law of addition)

a+0 = 0+a = a (existence of additive inverses)

a+(-a) = (-a)+a = a (existence of additive inverses)

a+b = b+a (commutative law of addition)

a(bc) = (ab)c (associative law of multiplication)

a(1) = (1)a = a (multiplicative identity)

a(a<sup>-1</sup>) = a<sup>-1</sup>(a) = 1 (existence of multiplicative inverses)

a(b) = b(a) (commutative multiplication law)

a(b+c) = a(b) + a(c) (distributive law)
